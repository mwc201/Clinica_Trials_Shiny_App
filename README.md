## Addtional Notes:

In the Studies Info feature,

- In Condition Type, the category, Diabetes, includes studies that did not distinguish between the type of diabetes (Type 1 or 2). These may likely be Type 2 diabes because it is the most common type. The Other category includes studies of other less common diabetes types such as gestational diabetes or studies that do not specifically study diabetes but other diseases on diabetes patients.

- In Phase (Clinical Trial), the phase category N/A (or not applicable) represents trials without FDA-defined phases, including trials of devices or behavioral interventions.
